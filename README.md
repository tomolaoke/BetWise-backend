# BetWise: Your Fun Sports Betting Platform üèÜ

Welcome to **BetWise**, a cool sports betting platform where you can bet on football matches with virtual money, just like SportyBet! Think Premier League showdowns like Liverpool vs. Chelsea, with odds, bets, and payouts‚Äîall in Nigerian Naira (‚Ç¶) for our Nigerian users. This is the backend, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, making it fast and reliable. Whether you're a beginner or a pro, this guide will walk you through setting it up and testing it like a champ!

## What‚Äôs BetWise All About?

Imagine you‚Äôre at a stadium, betting on your favorite teams with virtual cash. Here‚Äôs how it works:
- **Admins** create matches (e.g., Manchester City vs. Tottenham) and set odds (like 2.0 for a win).
- **Users** sign up, get a virtual wallet, and place bets (e.g., ‚Ç¶1000 on Liverpool to win).
- **Results** are set by admins, and winners get payouts (coming soon!).
- **Wallet** shows your balance in ‚Ç¶ if you‚Äôre from Nigeria, or $ for others.

This backend powers it all with APIs (think of them as messengers) that let users sign up, bet, and check their winnings.

## Prerequisites: What You Need

Before we kick off, make sure you have these tools:
- **Node.js** (v14 or later): It‚Äôs like the engine for our app. [Download it](https://nodejs.org).
- **MongoDB**: Our database to store games and bets. [Install it](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
- **Postman**: A tool to test our APIs. [Get it](https://www.postman.com/downloads).
- **Git**: To grab the code. [Install it](https://git-scm.com).
- A computer and some excitement to build a betting app!

## Setup: Get BetWise Running

Follow these steps to set up the backend. It‚Äôs like setting up a game console‚Äîeasy peasy!

1. **Clone the Project**:
   Open a terminal (or Command Prompt) and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/betwise-backend.git
   cd betwise-backend
   ```
   This downloads the code to your computer.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run this to get all the tools the app needs:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   It‚Äôs like downloading game updates‚Äîit might take a minute!

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a file called `.env` in the `betwise-backend` folder and add:
   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/betwise
   JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey123
   PORT=5000
   ```
   - `MONGODB_URI`: Where the database lives.
   - `JWT_SECRET`: A secret code for user logins (make it unique!).
   - `PORT`: Where the app runs (5000 is fine).


4. **Start MongoDB**:
   Make sure MongoDB is running. In a terminal, run:
   ```bash
   mongod
   ```
   If it‚Äôs running, you‚Äôll see some logs. Keep this terminal open.

5. **Start the Server**:
   In another terminal, in the `betwise-backend` folder, run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   You should see:
   ```
   Server running on port 5000‚Äîlet‚Äôs bet!
   MongoDB connected‚Äîready to store games and bets!
   ```
   Your backend is now live at `http://localhost:5000`!

## Testing with Postman: Be the Referee!

Now, let‚Äôs test all the APIs using **Postman** to make sure everything works. Open Postman and set the base URL to `http://localhost:5000`. Each test below shows the request, JSON, and what to expect. Follow these like a playbook!

### Before You Start
- **Get Postman Ready**: Create a new collection called ‚ÄúBetWise‚Äù in Postman to organize your requests.
- **Admin Setup**: Some endpoints (like creating games) need an admin user. We‚Äôll set one up in the tests.
- **Tokens**: For protected endpoints, you‚Äôll need a JWT token. We‚Äôll get these from login.
- **Wallet Funds**: We‚Äôll add virtual ‚Ç¶ to test betting.

### 1. Register a User
Create a new user to start betting.

- **Request**: POST `http://localhost:5000/auth/register`
- **Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Body** (JSON):
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Chidi",
    "email": "chidi@example.com",
    "password": "bet123456",
    "country": "Nigeria"
  }
  ```
- **Expected Response** (201):
  ```json
  {
    "token": "<jwt_token>"
  }
  ```
- **Check**:
  - Status is 201.
  - Copy the `token` for later (this is your user token).
  - The user is saved with a ‚Ç¶0 wallet.

### 2. Log In
Log in to get a fresh token (in case the old one expires).

- **Request**: POST `http://localhost:5000/auth/login`
- **Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Body** (JSON):
  ```json
  {
    "email": "chidi@example.com",
    "password": "bet123456"
  }
  ```
- **Expected Response** (200):
  ```json
  {
    "token": "<jwt_token>"
  }
  ```
- **Check**:
  - Status is 200.
  - Copy the `token` for user actions (e.g., betting).

### 3. Create an Admin User
We need an admin to create games and set results.

- **Register Admin**:
  - **Request**: POST `http://localhost:5000/auth/register`

      "password": "admin123456",
      "country": "Nigeria"
    }
    ```
- **Make Admin**:
  - Open MongoDB (e.g., via MongoDB Compass or `mongo` shell).
  - Run:
    ```javascript
    use betwise;
    db.users.updateOne(
      { email: "admin@example.com" },
      { $set: { isAdmin: true } }
    );
    ```

  - `stake` is `‚Ç¶1000`, `payout` is `‚Ç¶2000` (1000 √ó 2.0 odds).
  - In MongoDB, check `users` collection: Chidi‚Äôs `wallet` is now `4000` (5000 - 1000).

  - Bet is listed with `‚Ç¶` formatting for Nigerian users.

### 9. Set Game Result (Admin)

- **Request**: PATCH `http://localhost:5000/games/<game_id>/result`
- **Headers**:
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>`
- **Body** (JSON):

    "balance": "‚Ç¶4000",
    "country": "Nigeria"
  }
  ```
- **Check**:
  - Status is 200.
  - Balance is `‚Ç¶4000` after the ‚Ç¶1000 bet.

## Troubleshooting: If Things Go Wrong

- **Server Won‚Äôt Start**: Check if MongoDB is running (`mongod`) and `.env` is set correctly.
- **Token Errors**: Re-login to get a fresh token. Ensure `Authorization: Bearer <token>` is set in Postman.
- **Game Not Found**: Use `GET /games` to find a valid `gameId`. Create a new game if needed.
- **Not Enough Funds**: Update the user‚Äôs `wallet` in MongoDB (e.g., `db.users.updateOne(...)`).
- **Admin Access**: Ensure the admin user has `isAdmin: true` in MongoDB.
